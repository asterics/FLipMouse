 
This document contains all additional information to the construction manual, which has a few minor errors.

Please read this file carefully!
Probably it is a good idea to write down all information from here to a printed version of the construction manual.

Page 3:

-) The rubber pad plate has a smaller hole than it is drawn on the picture
-) The 22R resistor is a now 12R resistor 

Page 7:

-) ATTENTION: please take care of the orientation of the sensor PCB! The correct orientation is shown on the picture (5-pin holes on the PCB vs. bulges on the acrylic part)

Page 11/12:

-) The soldering of the TeensyLC works better if it is already placed on the PCB. So don't remove the Teensy while soldering

Page 13: 

-) Bend the pins of the pressure sensor as much as it is necessary to have a narrow space between PCB and sensor

Page 21:

-) Again: it is a 12R resistor now
-) Please bend the resistor's pins as tight as possible, otherwise the buzzer won't fit well

Page 22:

-) Bend the LEDs BEFORE soldering. The adjustment will be easier then (switch the last two steps)

Page 23:

-) Bend the LED BEFORE soldering (switch the last two steps)

Page 25:

-) ATTENTION: please take care of the sensor and DO NOT remove anything else than the transparent foil on the bottom, otherwise the sensor is broken.

Page 26:

-) Please take care of the sensor, especially if you solder with a high temperature. Maybe you cool down the plastics with tweezers

Page 28:

-) Glue the screw nut, this is an important step.
-) Turn the M4 screws until 1-2mm of the tip is visible on the other side ("not too much" is not precise enough)

Page 29:

-) ATTENTION: the angled pin header is used to adjust the PCB position. So don't solder the connector if you are not 100% if it fits. It's better
to solder only 1pin out of 5, assemble the FLipMouse and if it fits, solder the remaining ones. Also take care of the positioning: the longer pins are soldered to the main PCB.
