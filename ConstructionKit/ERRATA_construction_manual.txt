Please read this file carefully!
Probably it is a good idea to write down all information from here to a printed version of the construction manual.

We are currently changing the construction kit to simplify the resistor soldering.
You have to follow either one of the listed options:

Option 1 (Currently in the manual, a little bit more complex):

You get 5 resistors:
1x 12R (big, brown housing)
1x 120R (small, blue housing; with ONE mark on the leads)
2x 10k (small, blue housing; with TWO marks on the leads)
1x 4k7 (small, blue housing; with THREE marks on the leads)

Please be careful to distinct all indiviual resistors BEFORE soldering!!!
On page 21, the places of the resistors are shown.


Option 2 (Currently not shown in the manual, easier to distinct the resistors):

You get 5 resistors:
1x 12R (big, brown housing)
1x 120R (small, brown housing)
3x 4k7 (small, blue housing)

On page 21, the old values are shown. You have to place two 4k7 resistors instead of the 10k resistors.
Due to the different housing colors, no marks are necessary
