# ConstructionManual

This construction manual contains instructions how to build the FlipMouse from the official DIY-Kit which can be ordered from Hackspaceshop.com
(see: https://hackerspaceshop.com/products/flipmouse-diy-kit). If you want to use one of the 3D-printed cases instead of the laser-cut acrylic case,
just start at page 8 (ignoring the parts about case assembly). Depending on the 3d-print design you use there will be some other differences when it comes to mounting the FSR-sensors / sensor carrier. If you need help, contact us via email (office@asterics-foundation.org).
 

## FotoGuides

In the subfolder FotoGuides you find two instruction manuals written by UAS Technikum Wien students who built the FlipMouse in course of a lecture. 
One manual is written in german language, the other one in english. These instructions might be useful because they conatin photos of the build process.

**Have Fun building your FlipMouse !! **
