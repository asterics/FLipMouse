## FotoGuides

In the subfolder FotoGuides you find two instruction manuals written by UAS Technikum Wien students who built the FlipMouse in course of a lecture. 
One manual is written in german language, the other one in english. These instructions might be useful because they conatin photos of the build process.

** Have fun building your FlipMouse !! **
