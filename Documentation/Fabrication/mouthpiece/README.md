# FLipMouse - Mouthpiece

**Fabrication Note v1.0, AsTeRICS Foundation**

![FLipMouseLogo](./img/flipmouseLogo.png)

# Scope

The FLipMouse needs a stick in front to be actuated via finger or lip movements. From 2022 on, the AsTeRICS Foundation produces the mouthpieces in-house.

Basic components of the mouthpiece are:

1. Acryllic pipe, variable length
2. Male Luer Lock adapter to M6
3. Filter

The acryllic pipe (Ø10/6mm) is glued to the Luer Lock adapter with epoxy resin.

# Procedure

__Cut the acryllic pipe:__

1. Adjust the mitre saw _{2}_ to the necessary length: 50, 100, 120 or 150mm
2. Cut as many pipes _[3]_ as you want to produce
3. Use the heat gun _{3}_ at **500°C** and heat up both ends for ~**5s** (removing the burr)



__Prepare holder and epoxy resin:__

1. Place as many female luer lock adapters _[2]_ in the holder _{4}_ as you want to produce. Take care that both hex nuts are in the holder.
2. Attach a male luer lock adapter _[1]_ on each female adapter by pushing and turning 180°.
3. Mix epoxy resin 50:50 in the mixing pan (TBA: give here a weight for a full holder)



__Glueing:__

1. Use the toothpick to apply epoxy resin on the male luer lock's _[1]_ M6 thread. __Note:__ do NOT apply too much and start applying directly on the thread.
2. Push the acryllic pipe _[3]_ on the luer lock adapter _[1]_. __Note:__ make sure you have clean hands.
3. Repeat for all luer lock adapters
4. Use paper or a tissue to remove any surplus epoxy.



`Wait for 12h`



__Finalize:__

1. Us the sand paper _{5}_ to make a 45° / 1mm chamfer on the outside of the mouthpiece; remove any burr inside the acryllic pipe (either with sand paper, a big drill with ~10mm or a countersunk head)
1. Use the heat gun _{3}_ at ~500°C and heat up the top for ~5 to have rounded edges
2. Put a filter _[4]_ into the acryllic pipe
3. TBA: how to mark the mouthpieces with a chargenumber?
4. Unscrew the luer locks, the female luer lock can be put into the construction kit.
