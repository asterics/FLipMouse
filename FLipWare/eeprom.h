   General EEPROM memory layout:
   (0x7FFF is the max address in case of a 256kbit EEPROM)

   0x0000-0x006D	struct storageHeader
   0x006E-0xXXXX	setting slots

   layout of one slot:
     struct SlotSettings
     struct slotButtonSettings[NUMBER_OF_BUTTONS]
     char buttonParameter[len][NUMBER_OF_BUTTONS] ('\0' terminated strings)

   0x7FFE-0xXXXX	IR code storage 
   Note that the IR slots start at the top address (0x7FFE, top->down)

   layout of one IR command slot:
     char irSlotName[MAX_NAME_LEN]  ('\0' terminated string)
     uint8_t countEdges     
     uint16_t timings[countEdges]

   0x7FFF  Magic Byte to indicate valid EEPROM content
