# FLipmouse Addons

This folder contains any additional piece of software hardware or gadget to increase the usability of the FLipmouse.
Since there is are 2 extension headers on the FLipmouse PCB, it is easy to extend the functionality.


## BT-module

The BT module is an ESP32 based addon board for the FLipMouse v2. It is placed on a separate module on the __AUX__ extension header.
This folder here contains the KiCAD design files for PCB production.
Please refer to [esp32_mouse_keyboard](https://github.com/asterics/esp32_mouse_keyboard) repository for the corresponding source code.
