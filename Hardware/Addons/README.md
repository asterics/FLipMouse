# FLipmouse Addons

This folder contains any additional piece of software hardware or gadget to increase the usability of the FLipmouse.
Since there is are 2 extension headers on the FLipmouse PCB, it is easy to extend the functionality.


## FLipmouse side-mount (side_mount)

The standard FLipmouse is mounted via a hotshoe adapter (used for cameras and flash lights) on the rear of the case.
In some mounting situations its a little bit tricky to mount the device without touching the user.
For this occasions, a special acrylic glass part was built to mount the FLipmouse on the side.

This part needs to be cutted with the lasercutter and bent to a 90Â° angle (with hot-air support on the edge).
Afterwards it is possible to mount this piece to the stand/tripod and put the FLipmouse into it.
