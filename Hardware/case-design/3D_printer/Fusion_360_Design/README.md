# 3D Printed Case

This case consists of three parts. The main case where the PCB and sensors are located. A lid which closes everything up and a mouth piece holder.

You need these additinal things to have a fully functional case:

* 1x M3 screw nut (not needed but useful, RS component: 278-584)
* 1x M3 screw

This case was designed with Fusion 360. If you want to edit the Fusion 360 file (.f3d) you need to be a student, buy it, or use the 30 day free trail.

### Things to improve

* The LED holes are a bit offset
* The IR LED is still inside the case and could be located like the other LEDs between the lid and main case
* The plate which holds the FSR Sensors has a hole in the middle which is too small
* The hole for the TSOP is offset and too small
* The screw hole in the back is to tight for the screw nut
