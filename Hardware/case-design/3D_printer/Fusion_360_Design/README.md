# 3D Printed Case

This case was designed with Fusion 360. If you want to edit the Fusion 360 file (.f3d) you need to be a student, buy it, or use the 30 day free trail.

### Assembly

This case consists of three parts. The main case where the PCB and sensors are located. A lid which closes everything up and a mouth piece holder.

You need these additinal things to have a fully functional case:

* 1x M3 screw nut (not needed but useful, RS component: 278-584)
* 1x M3 screw

The nut and screw are located in the back where the lid and main case meet.

Altough, there are no screw nuts intended in the front of the case which hold the sensor carrier, this can be changed easily.

The front plate also contains a cross which is just there to hold the top part from falling while printing. The cross parts should be removed after the print.

### Parameters

The design has some parameters which can be changed under Modify -> Parameters.

![Parameters](../../../../img/fusion_design_parameters.png)

* wall_thickness: Changes the thickness everywhere. This can be adjusted to fit the width of your printer nozzle.
* board_width: Width of the PCB.
* height_above_board: The distance from the board to the top of the case. This doesnÂ´t need to be changed aslong as the PCB elements or the sensor carrier PCB do not change in height.
* height_below_board: The distance between board and the bottom layer. If your handle is higher and toches the PCB you need to adjust this parameter to not produce a short.
* lid_holder_thickness: The lid has to thin plastic pieces to keep its positiion. If they are to thin you can change them here.
* mouth_piece_holder_thickness: The thickness of the plate holding the mouth piece. We notices that the plate could bend with time if its too thin.

### Things to improve

* The IR LED is still inside the case and could be located like the other LEDs between the lid and main case
* More parameters to distiguish between usage with screw nuts and without
