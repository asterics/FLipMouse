There are different file versions, depending on the manufacturing process and different versions:

### lipmouse_case_lasercut.cdr

Process: Lasercut
Software: Corel Draw, Version X5 minimum

This is the current case design for the FLipmouse.
It contains one FLipmouse case on a 125mmx250mm acrylic glass.

Engraving and cutting objects are placed and grouped on different layers, which have to be selected in 2 steps.
If you have a sophisticated printer (and software) you may use the different color codes and print the case in one step.
The different layers are split into individual *.svg files and a combined one, for people without CorelDraw.
