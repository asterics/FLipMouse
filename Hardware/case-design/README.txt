There are different file versions, depending on the manufacturing process and different versions:

### lipmouse_case_lasercut.cdr

Process: Lasercut
Software: Corel Draw, Version X5 minimum

This is the current case design for the FLipmouse.
It contains only 2 FLipmouse cases on a 250mmx250mm acrylic glass.

The lasercut settings are as following:

* Green and black -> vector, cutting
* Red -> vector + raster, engrave
* Order of cutting: black,red,green

### lipmouse_case_lasercut_2.cdr

This file is nearly the same as the previous one, only the color black is replaced by the color blue.
This step was necessary, because Epilog lasercutter software does not allow a sequence change of the black color.
The lasercut settings are the same as previous, except the order and the colors of cutting (blue, red, green).


### lipmouse_case_lasercut_with_1button.cdr

Same FLipmouse case as in lipmouse_case_lasercut, an additional button case is added.
This button case can be used for 30mm core drill buttons.


### FLipmouse_Lasercut.sgx

Process: Lasercut
Software: SpiritGX lasercutter printer driver

This file contains the necessary settings for the lasercutter driver.
Optimized for following parameters (Happylab in Vienna):

60W laser power
