There are different file versions, depending on the Lipmouse design (especially the mouth piece and mounting construction):

###lipmouse_case_lasercut.cdr

This is the original design, produced by Robert Haderer.
It uses a cigarette mouthpiece, which is plugged into plate2


###lipmouse_case_lasercut_v2.5_backmount.cdr

Improved case design: top plate mounting parts are moved inside the housing, making a smaller outline;
closed a small gap at the backplane (improves stability and design)
contains a part for testing and productive laser cutting.
Future versions will have 2 housings on a 250mmx250mm acrylic glass.
Added the settings file lipsy_v2.3.sgx for the laser cutter software (Spirit GX). These settings are valid for all future versions of the CDR files, except there is a SGX file with a higher version number
